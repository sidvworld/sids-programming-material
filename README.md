# Some of the best implementations of common programs in C, C++ and Java

Hello! If you are struggling to break through into core programming languages like C, C++, or Java, check out this repo.

Everything here shows **exactly** what I did, from flowcharts to diagrams to psuedocode to actual programs, this is an extensive documentation of my own journey to mastering the basics of these languages.

I hope this finds you well if you are in need for just a quick example of what organized, efficient, and thoughtful code development looks like. Thank you for checking it out!
